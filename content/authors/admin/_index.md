    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a Dutch master student of software engineering at Kungliga Tekniska HÃ¶gskolan (KTH) in Stockholm ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. My major is geared towards distributed computing, which takes many forms. My bachelor I completed at the University of Applied Sciences in Rotterdam (HR) in 2022. Currently (spring 2025) I will be working with the Data Systems Lab at KTH in collaboration with the Research institute Sweden to research the use of CRDTs in a stream processing environment.
